# Gaudi In a Day! 

The idea behind this project was to give **Gaudi** lovers a chance to view as much **architecture** in one day as they can when having the opportunity of being in the beautiful **Barcelona**. I personally have never been to **Barcelona** but I would love to get the oppertunity to go one day to see **Gaudi's** work. 

This **Single Page Application** has some information on the **architecture** and **Gaudi** for people who arrive on the page non the wiser of him or what he is known for.

## UX 


The end user of this project is for people who have a keen interest in **Art and Architecture**. The users would range from any age. It will be used mainly on **mobile and tablet devices** going by the technology used in this day and age, but can also be accessible through desktop comfortably. 

The end user wants to see information on **Antoni Gaudi** himself and his work. 
 

The benefit of the project is to show off the **Gaudi building's** in an inviting way with **bright colours** and a **user-friendly** style just like some of the **mosaic** on his buildings.

## Design
The theme of this project is called Gaudi In a Day. It will be based on his architecture. 

**Fonts**: I have chose [**Nato Sans**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP), I have chose this font as it is simple and easy to read from.

**Colours**: Colours I am going with chosen colours from the mosaic in the landing pages which will range from oranges, reds and blues. They stand out nicely with the white that the rest of the site will be. The orange I picked is [Spanish Orange](https://github.com/Taitdanielle/Gaudi-In-a-Day/blob/master/wireframes/colour.png). 

**Images**: Will be selected carefully of 3 buildings from Antonio Gaudiâ€™s collection and most well known work.

**Test**: Testing on mobile screens to ensure layout was as how it should be. 

**Implementation**: Having to remove the VH of 100 as this moved it's contence down which resulted in a cluster of content which looked very messy and was unreadable. 

**Result**: Removed all VH and added padding instead to ensure layout is now fixed. All 3 images click correctly and link down to image an information

**Test**: Tested use of filling out contact form and modal.

**Implementation**: Filled in form and checked  button worked.

**Result**: Form won't submit due to running out of time to test it as a submitting button without interfering with my modal. Modal works correctly on all screens.



Images with the paragraph of information, I played around with order and d-flex how ever it did interfere with the desktop version and layout which I didn't have time to play about with much as I only discovered it. 

Manual testing was also conducted to ensure the user story objectives were achieved.

## Bugs

**Bug**: At the beginning of this project I knew what I wanted it to look like, I unfortunately focused on Desktop screen more that Mobile this meant that the 3 card images that are click-able with the 3 buildings were supposed to grow in size I later found out that when being selected they were moving the titles of the images and the about section with Gaudi.

**Fix**: To fix this I removed the growth as it didn't work well with tablet or mobile and applied an opacity blur to the images which looks a lot better.

**Result**: Images can now be clicked, No movement of the titles.

**Bug**:I also came to learn the smooth scrolling behaviour I had implemented for a smooth transaction between the navigation bar and the images wasn't working on most browsers.

**Fix**: Would be to find a more better option.

**Result**: I have kept it for better UX when on tablets/mobiles.

**Bug:** The Contact Form form when you submit it it doesn't actually submit the information collected.

**Fix:** Fix for this would be to turn the button into a submit button but without it interfering with the modal.

**Result:** Unfortunately  I ran out of time before this could get resolved.
