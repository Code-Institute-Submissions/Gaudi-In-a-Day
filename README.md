# Gaudi In a Day! 

 

Milestone 1 Project - User-Centric Frontend Development 

The idea behind this project was to give Gaudi lovers a chance to cram in as much architecture in one day as they can when having the opportunity of being in Barcelona. I personally have never been to Barcelona but would love to one day to see Gaudi's work like this page does. It has some information on the buildings and information of Gaudi for people who arrive on the page non the wiser of him. So if they look for Gaudi's architecture. 

 
 

 

# UX 
 

The end user of this project is for people who have a keen interest in Art and Architecture. The users would range from any age. It will be used mainly on mobile and tablet devices going by the technology used in this day and age but can also be accessible through desktop comfortably. 
 

The end user wants to see information on Antoni Gaudi himself and his work. 
 

The benefit of the project is to show off the Gaudi building's in an inviting way with bright colours and a user-friendly style just like some of the mosaic on his buildings.
