# Gaudi In a Day! 

The idea behind this project was to give Gaudi lovers a chance to view as much architecture in one day as they can when having the opportunity of being in the beautiful Barcelona. I personally have never been to Barcelona but I would love to get the oppertunity to go one day to see Gaudi's work. This Single Page Application has some information on the architecture and Gaudi for people who arrive on the page non the wiser of him or what he is known for.

## UX 


The end user of this project is for people who have a keen interest in Art and Architecture. The users would range from any age. It will be used mainly on mobile and tablet devices going by the technology used in this day and age, but can also be accessible through desktop comfortably. 

The end user wants to see information on Antoni Gaudi himself and his work. 
 

The benefit of the project is to show off the Gaudi building's in an inviting way with bright colours and a user-friendly style just like some of the mosaic on his buildings.

## Design
The theme of this project is called Gaudi In a Day. It will be based on his architecture. 

Fonts: I have chose **Nato Sans**, I have chose this font as it is simple and easy to read from.
Colours: Colours I am going with chosen colours from the mosiac in the landing pages which will range from oranges, reds and blues. They stand out nicely with the white that the rest of the site will be. 
Images: Will be selected carefully of 3 buildings from Antonio Gaudis collection and most well known work.
