# Gaudi In a Day! 

The idea behind this project was to give Gaudi lovers a chance to view as much architecture in one day as they can when having the opportunity of being in the beautiful Barcelona. I personally have never been to Barcelona but I would love to get the oppertunity to go one day to see Gaudi's work. This Single Page Application has some information on the architecture and Gaudi for people who arrive on the page non the wiser of him or what he is known for.

## UX 


The end user of this project is for people who have a keen interest in Art and Architecture. The users would range from any age. It will be used mainly on mobile and tablet devices going by the technology used in this day and age, but can also be accessible through desktop comfortably. 

The end user wants to see information on Antoni Gaudi himself and his work. 
 

The benefit of the project is to show off the Gaudi building's in an inviting way with bright colours and a user-friendly style just like some of the mosaic on his buildings.  
 

Other features that are to note is the user can get in touch easily by navigation to the social links.

## Design
The theme of this project is called Gaudi In a Day. It will be based on his architecture. 

* Fonts: I have chose **Nato Sans**, I have chose this font as it is simple and easy to read from.
* Colours: Colour I chose is an burned orange as my main colour. This was taken from the mosaic, I felt this colour would stand out and be easy be easily read against the white back drop.
* Images: Will be selected carefully of 3 buildings from Antonio Gaudis collection and most well known work.
* Icons: The icons used are self explanatory so that the user does not need to struggle to notice what the icon will actually do. I use the icon to display the classic ‘burger-button’ on tablet and mobile devices.

## Bugs
At the begining of this project I knew what I wanted it to look like, I unfortunetly focused on Desktop screen more that Mobile this meant that the 3 card images that are click-able with the 3 buildings were supposed to grow in size I later found out that when being selected they were moving the titles of the images and the about section with Gaudi. To fix this I removed the groth as it didn't work well with tablet or mobile and applied a opacity blur ot the images which looks alot better.

The Contact form when you submit it it doesn't actually submit the form, I found this out via Dev tools on the Google Chrome.

I also came to learn the smooth scrolling behaviour I had implamened for a smooth transaction between the navigation bar and the images wasn't working on most browesers. but I have kept it for better UX when on tablets/mobiles.

This was used on a number of occasions to find bugs with my code and missing items this was found on Dev tools and code verifier.
